# Scratch Up Catalog

The idea was presented at the Open Finland Challenge 2015 by Heidi Karinen: [Scratch up project catalogue For faster matchmaking of ideas and enablers of development projects](https://trello.com/c/8xmHkD1D/117-scratch-up-project-catalogue-for-faster-matchmaking-of-ideas-and-enablers-of-development-projects).

There is [demo](https://scratch-up-catalog.herokuapp.com/) of the catalog that allows:
* User signup and login
* Adding project ideas
* Searching project ideas
* Users to specify interesting roles and add other profile information
* Searching volunteers based on roles and idea needs

The most important part missing to make the demo actual product is messaging between the users. However, the UI does include the features for messaging, just the server part for messaging (sending emails) is missing.

There are also some additional notes with misleading name of the [project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cw6kLCVMEd4R6C75SHJQO4TrDSSdREfwzHHyH9wicIE/edit?usp=sharing). Anyone interested is most welcome to write project plan and implement the actual finished product.
