# Scratch Up Catalog

The idea was presented at the Open Finland Challenge 2015 by Heidi Karinen: [Scratch up project catalogue For faster matchmaking of ideas and enablers of development projects](https://trello.com/c/8xmHkD1D/117-scratch-up-project-catalogue-for-faster-matchmaking-of-ideas-and-enablers-of-development-projects).

There are also some additional notes with (at leas at the moment) misleading name of the [project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cw6kLCVMEd4R6C75SHJQO4TrDSSdREfwzHHyH9wicIE/edit?usp=sharing).
