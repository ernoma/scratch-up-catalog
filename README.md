# Scratch Up Catalog

The idea was presented at the Open Finland Challenge 2015 by Heidi Karinen: [Scratch up project catalogue For faster matchmaking of ideas and enablers of development projects](https://trello.com/c/8xmHkD1D/117-scratch-up-project-catalogue-for-faster-matchmaking-of-ideas-and-enablers-of-development-projects).

There are also some additional notes with (at leas at the moment) misleading name of the [project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cw6kLCVMEd4R6C75SHJQO4TrDSSdREfwzHHyH9wicIE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Roadmap

<ul>
    <li>Add user, list users based on their skills
    <li>Add project, list projects with their status
    <li>Allow user to easily ask other user to join project
</ul>

### Second version

 <ul>
    <li>Based on feedback by Heidi
    <li>Not yet a &quot;release&quot; version
    <li>Implementation is based on existing 3rd party libraries and software as much as sensible, the first version code maybe totally discarded
</ul>
  
### Third version

    <li>First release
    <li>Based on the feedback by Heidi
    <li>Based on the tuned, commented, etc. second version implementation
